Ale yeasts are generally regarded as top-fermenting yeasts since they rise to the surface during fermentation, creating a very thick, rich yeast head. That is why the term &quot;top-fermenting&quot; is associated with ale yeasts. Fermentation by ale yeasts at these relatively warmer temperatures produces a beer high in esters, which many regard as a distinctive character of ale beers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Top-fermenting yeasts are used for brewing ales, porters, stouts, Altbier, Kölsch, and wheat beers. *&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lager yeast strains are best used at temperatures ranging from 7 to 15°C. At these temperatures, lager yeasts grow less rapidly than ale yeasts, and with less surface foam they tend to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter as fermentation nears completion. This is why they are often referred to as &quot;bottom&quot; yeasts. The final flavour of the beer will depend a great deal on the strain of lager yeast and the temperatures at which it was fermented. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the lager styles made from bottom-fermenting yeasts are Pilsners, Dortmunders, Märzen, Bocks, and American malt liquors.* &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(all information from &lt;a href=&quot;http://beeradvocate.com/&quot;&gt;http://beeradvocate.com/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2014-01-21T20:47:17.840" CommentCount="0" />

For some time, working folk had been drinking a blend of beer, ale, and strong beer, which pubs would mix to balance out their stocks and maintain acceptable flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entire&lt;/em&gt; was a pre-mixed version, brewed by Hardwood then sold and delivered to pubs.  Prior to this point, each pub had mixed their own.  In addition to economies of scale, Harwood's method allowed for aging of the finished product.  Historians theorize that the name &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; came about because of the porters who worked at the markets and delivered the final product to the pubs.  A variation of this theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; simply refers to the working class occupations of those who drank the concoction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that &lt;em&gt;porter&lt;/em&gt; comes from the Netherlands, where a beer called &lt;em&gt;poorter&lt;/em&gt; was being made as early as the 1300s.

Popsci has a LOT of cool beer articles. Fractional freezing is the best way to increase the alcohol content of beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fractional freezing -- &quot;jacking&quot; in old parlance -- has a long history in the United States. The beverage applejack was produced using this method by first fermenting apple juice into hard apple cider. Then barrels of this cider were left outside during the winter and the connoisseur would occasionally fish out the frozen chunks of water, leaving an ever-concentrated batch of hard alcohol behind. At some point in the 20-25 percent ABV range, the liquor would stop freezing at ambient temperatures and the booze was ready to consume as &quot;Jersey Lightning.&quot; It was also used as currency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving into the malt-beverage world, brewers in Germany use fractional freezing to make eisbock. These brews are usually just regular bock beers, which clock in at 6 percent ABV, freeze-concentrated to something in the 13 percent ABV range. Frankly, there are probably easier ways to get high-proof beers (make a barleywine, for example) than by starting with a mid-strength one and concentrating it, but there's a market for eisbocks and it's possible to find them in the US as well. A more infamous set of freeze-concentrated beers was made by the Scottish brewery BrewDog in their quest to make &quot;the strongest beer in the world.&quot; The first was Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a beer that started with an ABV in the teens and ended at 32 percent ABV. Then a little brewing war started up between BrewDog and German brewery Schorschbräu to make ever-stronger beers. Schorschbräu made a Schorschbock at 40 percent ABV, BrewDog countered with Sink the Bismarck at 41 percent ABV. Then came another beer at 55 percent ABV (that's 110 proof, my friends). Schorschbräu is current record-holder with Schorschbock 57, at 57 percent ABV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/beersci-how-make-strong-beer-stronger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T04:13:55.660" CommentCount="2" />

New hop varieties are often developed by selective crossbreeding of existing variants, to generate different flavor profiles by adjusting the acidity and oil content of the hop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like different breeds of dogs, different hop varieties are often the products of hundreds of years of genetic development in a particular climate -  the Pacific Northwest, especially the Yakima Valley and Cascade Mountains in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, is known for it's production of very strong, highly acidic hops that impart a very strong bitter flavor - take a sip of a Sierra Nevada IPA and you'll instantly recognize that classic blend of the 'three C's'.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, traditional hops grown in England and on the European continent tend to be more mellow and aromatic - especially the so called 'noble hops' popular in many less bitter tasting German and Czech beers. Still others, like Japans Sorachi Ace, offer a more citrus bite to the beer they're added to. While these differences are not &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; a product of climate, it's doubtless true that climate has had an impact on the development of variation amongst the various hop lines that have been bred through the centuries -  and especially over the past 50 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put another way: New World vs. Old World Hops is a meaningful distinction, but it has less to do with climate and more to do with the difference in cultivation practices and the specific varietals popular with farmers in various regions. Growing conditions may have some impact, but the specific lineage matters &lt;em&gt;much, much more&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that those lineages tend to have significant geographic commonalities is as much an accident of history as it is of varying conditions, but it's nonetheless sufficiently meaningful that, in particular referring to hops from the Pacific Northwest evokes a very specific and comprehensible flavor profile in most educated beer drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T04:23:10.133" CommentCount="0" />

The phytoestrogen in hops appears to get itself &quot;caught&quot; by estrogen receptors, thereby blocking those receptors from catching estrogen it'd normally catch, thereby leaving higher levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;...but it's not that simple!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, from these findings alone, conclusions about male potency and sex drive can't be so easily drawn. Hormone interactions are sufficiently complex that researchers are still trying to untangle, isolate, and explain ever-more-specific biochemical pathways. Certainly the average Joe (or journalist) wouldn't be capable of appreciating the magnitude (or triviality) of the effects of biochemical pathways described in researchers' findings, much less draw definitive conclusions about physiological effects like &quot;potency,&quot; &quot;sex drive,&quot; and how it all affects, say, muscle-building. Not to mention all the other chemicals in play!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a very example of the latter, one site [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peaktestosterone.com/Testosterone_Beer.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] (which, unfortunately, ranks high among Google search results) is clearly biased, grasping for evidence to &quot;prove&quot; that beer has detrimental effects on testosterone activity. I'm not saying beer &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt;, but their article states that Xanthohumol, another compound found in hops, &quot;blocks testosterone,&quot; when in fact &lt;em&gt;the very paper it cites&lt;/em&gt; says (in its abstract nonetheless),&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although hops is commonly linked with phytoestrogenic effects, we identified XN [Xanthohumol] as a pure estrogen antogonist.

Do you know?—I sure don't—and probably no one does—else it'd have been stated by researchers themselves, without the &quot;help&quot; of attention-seeking bloggers and headline-hunting journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In conclusion,&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying these blogs, articles, and threads are necessarily &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;—they might be right, whether right-by-chance, or right-by-empiricism (observation).

Gruit was usually sold under papal license exclusive to certain areas at various monasteries and therefore represented a monopoly in Christian areas of the Catholic Church.  Traditionally it included plants such as yarrow, mugwort, henbane, sweet gale, bog rosemary, juniper, and more.  Some of these survive in gin recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why gruit has largely been replaced by hops is a fascinating and divisive historical question.  There may however have been a number of factors including the possibility (largely untested) that hops beers kept longer and the rising concern by Protestant (and even Catholic) nobles of the power of the economic power that this gave Catholic institutions.  What is known is that a campaign was waged against gruit and the purported (and likely actual) mind altering properties of it.  The use of gruit was more or less entirely supplanted by hops.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More recently some breweries have been experimenting with gruit beers for national pride and/or historical reasons.

You find it in the new world with drinks like chicha (an Andean drink where saliva provides the amylase to break down corn starch into sugars for fermentation), among Native Americans in North America as well, in early Europe, in early China, and early Japan as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grain fermenting is a remarkably complex process because yeast can't digest starch so you have to have some way of turning starches into sugars.  These break down into more or less three strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;malting (roasting sprouted grains).  Interestingly doesn't work for rice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;helper cultures, like they use to make sake.  Add a fungus that breaks down starch and then a yeast to eat the sugar.  Indonesian &quot;Tape&quot; (rice or cassava &quot;beer&quot; or paste) is done this way as is Chinese rice beer and wine.  As a bonus this also works on other starches, like yams (used in Malaysia).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chewing the grains to mix with saliva and then spitting in a bowl as with the Andean Chicha drink.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;South America has all three methods represented, as does early Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that different strategies are employed around the world suggests to my mind that brewing did not start somewhere and spread but was independently reinvented in different places.  It is probably for this reason extremely old, far older than we have direct evidence for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for beer, the question becomes what you mean.  If you mean fermented grains, we have no idea.  It's very very old and might go back to neolithic times if not even earlier (though I suspect that the organized grain agriculture of neolithic times was an absolute prerequisite to grain fermentation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you mean malt, yeast, and hops, we still don't know.  We have evidence that hops was cultivated for beer in Augustine's time, and Old Norse distinguishes between beer and ale by the use of hops but Old English &quot;beor&quot; means something different (probably very strong mead with herbs?), suggesting perhaps that the hops distinction post-dated the split of Old Norse (and thus 8th century), but that doesn't get you very far.  What is pretty clear is that it certainly predates our earliest records of the practice.  By how much and when did it become a separate drink?  I don't think we will ever know.  At any rate the early prevalence of hops as one herb used in brewing among many in early England and Scandinavia suggests (though does not prove) that hops were adopted (again as one herb among any) for beer brewing by the Germanic tribes, some time before we have written records.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now as for lager, these are far more recent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally as a note, until maybe a hundred years ago, before modern capping and beer cans, most beer would have been sold uncarbonated, but speciality beers were carbonated much like champagne is today.  My own home brewing experiments (I even brew as a history nut) with non-carbonated beers suggest that they are of an altogether different character than carbonated ones (owing to the carbonic acid in carbonated drinks).  The flavors are lighter, sweeter, brighter, and more distinct, and entirely different than &quot;flat&quot; beer.  This is because dissolved carbon dioxide imparts extra acidity to beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  It also occurs to me that controlled fermentation is one of the most common ways of preserving foods in the pre-industrial ages.

Both chronic and acute alcohol consumption have been shown in most (but not all) studies to inhibit testosterone production in the testes. This is believed to be caused by the metabolism of alcohol reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio both in the liver and the testes; since the synthesis of testosterone requires NAD+, this tends to reduce testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency. Alcohol intoxication can decrease sexual arousal, decrease pleasureability and intensity of orgasm, and increase difficulty in attaining orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since wikipedia show related soruce of that info and most of them are clinical research, we can say that alcohol have a negative effect on men.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In many women, alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, although it does lower the physiological signs of arousal. Women have a different response to alcohol intoxication. Studies have shown that acute alcohol consumption tends to cause increased levels of testosterone and estradiol. Since testosterone controls in part the strength of libido in women, this tends to cause an increase in interest in sex. Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women’s bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm. Some women report a greater sexual arousal with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a vaginal photoplethysmograph, which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Different from men, we can say alcohol have more pros beside few cons for women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Beer and couples&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Men&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beer is probably the least powerful aphrodisiac alcoholic drink. The alcohol percentage in beer is low, meaning that more liquid has to be consumed to raise men's testosterone levels to hit that &quot;comfortable&quot; level. Most beers are very nourishing and filling, and when too many of them are consumed, they can create an unpleasant stomachache. Drinking too much beer will make men go to the washroom more often, as well as create a bloating sensation. The effects of being bloated surely don't entice sexual encounters and won't lead men to seek out sexual opportunities. Yet, some special beers have a local reputation for increasing libido, but even with that, beer is not the best choice for men.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Women&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While hops in beer will have a negative impact on men’s hormonal balance, it may actually be positive for women. Hops has aphrodisiac-like qualities for women, as because of the phytoestrogen it contains, which mimic natural estrogen. Low sex drive in women is often cause by low levels of estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consuming beer, especially hop-rich varieties like IPA, could actually help restore hormonal balance and help with libido and also alleviate menopausal symptoms of fatigue, irritability and hot flashes&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="81" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T22:23:34.453" CommentCount="0" />

Serving beer at too high a pressure, or through a half-open faucet/tap agitates the beer, causing the foam you saw. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system is balanced by having the pressure inside the keg set to just a touch more (0.5-1psi) than the pressure resistance outside the keg. The pressure resistance outside the keg comes from the beer line and the tap - the longer the beer line, the more resistance. Also any increase in height between the keg and the end of the tap will increase resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But even if the system was originally balanced, with the right dispensing pressure or adequate length of beer line, there are still some things working against you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if the keg has been sloshed about, some of the carbon dioxide will have come out of the beer and into the headspace, creating more pressure.

The first, as you say, is widespread refrigeration.

But refrigeration makes this easier and thus cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second is actually the modern bottlecap which is a product of industrialization.  Before the bottlecap most beers were served uncarbonated.  They might be chilled or not, but they would have been entirely uncarbonated, shipped in wooden barrels, etc. and had an altogether different flavor and character than our modern beers.  My experience playing with these concepts as a homebrewer suggests that such beers were better suited to being served warm than comparably dark carbonated beers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand why, I think you have to look at carbonation and how temperature affects that.  Carbon dioxide is more soluble in cold water than warm water, so the warmer the beer is, the faster it goes flat, and the more it fizzes when opened.  So you have two ways carbonation affects the picture.  First it impacts the taste and serving conditions differently at different temperatures, and secondly it imparts a distinctive off-tang when the beer goes flat.  Temperature helps offset the latter to a mild extent but at the expense of the former.  I think this also helps explain why richer beers are more often served warm than lighter beers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastActivityDate="2014-01-23T08:39:06.640" CommentCount="0" />

The smoky bacon flavor comes both from the actual inclusion of bacon and from the smoked malt: &lt;em&gt;Briess Cherrywood Smoked Malt, Weyermann Beechwood Smoked Malt, House-smoked Hickory Malt&lt;/em&gt;.  As discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://beer.stackexchange.com/questions/53/does-chocolate-stout-contain-real-chocolate/65#65&quot;&gt;Does chocolate stout contain real chocolate?&lt;/a&gt;, certain flavors can be achieved through the malting process rather than through additional ingredients.  Similarly maple is fermentable and could be added directly to boost alcohol content and impart a more subtle maple flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, this beer does contain actual bacon and &quot;maple flavor&quot;.  To get a look at and when and how the flavors are added, we can look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/inspired-by-rogue-voodoo-doughnut-maple-bacon-ale&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this clone recipe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Name              Amount     Time        Use&#xA;Fenugreek         0.25 oz    5.0 min     Boil&#xA;Maple Extract     1.0 oz     6.0 days    Primary&#xA;Bacon, cooked     4.0 oz     0.0 days    Bottle&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here, fenugreek is added during the boil phase, while creating the wort.  The boiling helps extract the flavor from the herb.  Maple extract gets added later during fermentation.  Maple extract or syrup could be used, but syrup is more expensive and fermentable so a stronger maple flavor is being achieved with extract.  The official ingredient list calls for &quot;Pure Maple Flavoring&quot; so I assume the same is being done there.  Lastly the bacon is being added at the end.

This works for me because of very specific reasons and &lt;strong&gt;I am not recommending that anyone else try it.&lt;/strong&gt;  However, I get asthma frequently following upper respiratory illnesses (I have since I was a teenager).  I have a couple of alternative medical strategies for dealing with this depending on what is available.  Note, if you have asthma, don't take medical advice from me: asthma can be life threatening.  Work with a doctor.   However, among other things, I find that drinking a number of drinks of beer or wine for two nights in a row will cause the asthma to clear up until I get sick again.  This naturally works best when I am not otherwise consuming alcohol, but it allows me to be mostly medication free regarding my asthma (doing this two to three times a year).  Again this has a bunch of risks, so I am mentioning it just for informational purposes.  In general anything medical deserves a great deal of respect because what can cure can kill.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also some kinds of traditional beer have very specific health benefits.  In Indonesia, &quot;tape hitam&quot; (black rice beer, consumed with the lees as a sort of soup) is generally understood to reduce blood cholesterol.

One evening you drank 10 Pilsner Urquells and the next you drink 8 Beck's.  How well are you really counting at that point?

You have to realize, as the Wikipedia article points out, that until the 1840's or so, most beer from the area was top-fermented (like ales; modern pilsners and lagers are bottom-fermented) and the taste varied widely, so I'm not sure how a beer 300-500 years ago would have tasted. The closest you'll likely be able to go back is the 1840's; in which case I'd give Pilsner Urquell a shot as it's the first pilsner beer in the world. Victory makes a mean pilsner (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.victorybeer.com/beers/braumeister-pils/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Braumeister Pils&lt;/a&gt;) too.

Yes, there are some breweries such as  Dogfish Head who recreate ancient ales. Yards has also recreated three brews based upon George Washington's, Thomas Jefferson's, and Ben Franklin's (my favorite of the three) original recipes. But for the most part, beer has evolved in the last 300-500 years; even in the case of the Dogfish Head and Yards brews I mentioned since they have to be pasteurized and must meet the (stupid) FDA standards here in the US. If you've ever tried raw milk, you know how much pasteurization changes the flavor; same goes for juice and beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, lets go back to the whole top-fermenting thing. You might want to give a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A4tzer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;grätzer&lt;/a&gt; a try as well. It's an ancient Polish beer which has been recently making a comeback.

However, since the brew is so (recently) new, I'm not sure how available it is; you'll likely have to make a trip to San Francisco to get some. There are others too, such as those offered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24134/81644/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Westbrook Brewing Co.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/piwo-grodziskie--gratzer-ale/157564/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Schlossbrauerei Au&lt;/a&gt;.

It isn't a question of availability today but there are other factors that likely have seasonal impact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally (say, 1000 years ago), yes, brewing recipes would vary with the seasons.  Some ingredients like henbane seed or barley keep extremely well.  Others do better  fresh (herbs and such).  It is likely that gruit components varied with the seasons.  This is not an issue today.  Aside from some components of other beers (pumpkin ale, beers with seasonal fruit), most beers today do not involve ingredients that are problematic to preserve over a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a second issue though.  That is that beers traditionally have another factor which is starch content.  The starch contributes significantly to calorie count of the beer, and usually darker, richer beers have higher carbohydrate count.  It makes sense to consume more calories in cold weather than warm weather, and it makes sense that darker, heavier beers would be favored in winter while lighter beers would be favored in summer (although as one would note the heavier beers came out of traditions of using them as bread substitutes for fasting monks and so would have year-round applicability in monasteries).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it has to do with availability.  I think instead it has to do with seasonal expectations and reserving richer, heavier, higher starch beers for the winter (we have higher metabolism in winter, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.mate.tue.nl/mate/pdfs/4319.pdf&lt;/a&gt;, and generally less availability of fresh foods before modern refrigeration and rapid transport).  I don't know when this became common though.  In general, when I look back a thousand years ago, I don't see anything in primary sources to suggest heavier malts in the winter.  So trying to date this would seem speculative.  There is a fairly obvious practical pattern though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  As I think about this, I would note that aside from lagers, it is very hard to brew in the winter in a colder climate.  There may also be a component where heavier, stronger beers keep better and therefore keep into the winter better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastEditorUserId="117" LastEditDate="2014-01-25T07:41:32.317" LastActivityDate="2014-01-25T07:41:32.317" CommentCount="3" />
  <row Id="322" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="268" CreationDate="2014-01-25T05:55:26.993" Score="4" Body="&lt;p&gt;The answer is complex, to be honest.  In the Middle Ages?  Where?  When?  These are important questions.  Lumping around a thousand years and very different cultural eras (ranging from the Vendell-era Norse to the Byzantine Empire) into the same label is problematic at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer I think to the question as stated has to be &quot;no&quot; insofar as there were times and places in the Middle Ages where beer was a clear luxury (early medieval Iceland comes to mind).  Similarly, it isn't always clear that beer was universally consumed by the lower classes in much of the Middle Ages (though certainly towards the end it became more common).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1:  Anglo-Saxon England&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This being said, beer was an important dietary staple in much (though not all!) of medieval Europe at least among monks, merchants, and the upper classes.  Heavier beers were used as bread substitutes.  For the common man in Anglo-Saxon England, though, even bread was a luxury  and most grains were cooked into gruel, porridge, either with or without fracturing (think of bulgur wheat).  This would then be supplemented with vegetables, eggs, dairy, and sometimes meat (even for the serfs, at least in Anglo-Saxon England, meat was not out of the question).  Well water was the primary source of hydration in this era (again see Hagen, below), and laws were passed to ensure that drinking water directly from someone else's well was protected, legal activity (in other words, a well owner could restrict what people could take away from the well, but not what they could drink on the spot).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we separate out the lower classes and the areas where beer was not commonly available (Iceland, for example) the picture changes dramatically.  Beer was very common, but not at all a homogeneous beverage.  Bald's Leechbook (10th Century, Anglo-Saxon) contains the warning that while &quot;&lt;em&gt;ealu&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (-&gt; ale) may be consumed by pregnant women, &quot;&lt;em&gt;beor&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (-&gt; beer) causes miscarriage.  Identifying these beverages is problematic. Ann Hagen (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&quot;) suggests that &quot;beor&quot; must have been a strong mead instead of a malt liquor based on descriptions of specific gravity (she calculates a minimum alcohol content of around 20%).  If it was a strong mead, it may have been further supplemented by herbs like mugwort, henbane, and hops, and therefore even more problematic than a strong mead might be.  In this case, it would have been fermented grains would have been certainly consumed by children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly the traditional fermented rice and cassava dishes here in Indonesia are acceptable to serve to children too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources on history&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hagen, Ann.  &quot;&lt;em&gt;Anglo-Saxon Food and Drink&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen.  &quot;&lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt;&quot; (for an edition of Bald's Leechbook with facing page translation).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2:  Medieval Iceland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The early Icelandic settlers tried to grow barley for beer with only very limited success.  Alcoholic beverages were thus very much a luxury item, and usually if someone was going to have it (going mostly by medieval saga evidence as ethnography), it was going to be someone who had gone viking and returned with a fair bit of wealth.  A second point though is that Icelandic society recognized about three levels of society (&lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt;) based on relationship to certain kinds of property:  a &lt;em&gt;godhi&lt;/em&gt; (priest-attorney-legislator-jurist) owned a &lt;em&gt;godhord&lt;/em&gt; (the office was property and could be sold, loaned, or even put into partnership property).  A &lt;em&gt;bondi&lt;/em&gt; (free juryman) owned land.  And a &lt;em&gt;thrall&lt;/em&gt; was owned (though the actual requirements would have been more like early serfdom than slavery due to a lack of central administration and enforcement).  In addition to successful bondi-turned-vikings, you would have had the fact that a godhi had sufficient economic benefits from office to likely be able to afford alcoholic beverages at least sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Iceland, drinking was usually a social action and as far as the existing evidence goes would have been a specifically male activity limited to the sorts of ritualized drinking portrayed in Beowulf (such ritualized drinking is portrayed in the Volsung Saga, Egill's Saga, Njall's Saga, and many many others).  Drunkenness was warned against in the literature, and there are very interesting questions of what else was put in the beverages, since poisoning was a pretty clear concern in the literature (Eddic poems such as Havamal and Sigdrifumal speak to both these concerns).  From archaeological evidence from &quot;continental&quot; Scandinavia, we may surmise henbane was common, and this may to some extent play into the references to military drinking in Hrolf Kraki's Saga.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, in Iceland, as far as we can tell, beer and mead would have been limited to far more ritualized roles (reinforcing social obligations, certain forms of oaths, etc).  Literature on women and alcohol is very sparse.  It's probable that the bride drank at the wedding as part of making the wedding official.  There's a lot of uncertainty beyond this however in terms of attitudes towards pregnancy and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further reading:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the various sagas referenced above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/em&gt; (I usually recommend the Hollander translation if you are going to work in translation because he tends to be transparent about which emendations he is using).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Viking-Age Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Byock, Jesse:  &lt;em&gt;Medieval Iceland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Roesdahl, Else: &lt;em&gt;The Vikings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pollington, Stephen: &lt;em&gt;Leechcraft&lt;/em&gt; (for some archaeological discussions of Scandinavian forts and brewing).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastEditorUserId="2585" LastEditDate="2014-12-20T02:01:47.893" LastActivityDate="2014-12-20T02:01:47.893" CommentCount="0" />

The tang you feel is dissolved metal and a component of that, depending on the pewter, may be lead (or could be copper, tin, bismuth, antimony, etc).  A major factor in that is acidity, and both hops and carbonation contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Acidic solutions react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and dissolved metal salts.  So carbonic acid from carbonated beer will react with the tin to produce hydrogen and tin carbonate, and the same basic process with other metals.

Could be fun, though.  :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most commercial beer is &lt;em&gt;force-carbonated&lt;/em&gt;.

The beer is intentionally left with a little of the yeast from the fermentation process, and is sealed with the sugar.  The yeast then does it's normal thing: it eats the sugar and excretes alcohol plus carbon-dioxide.  Since the bottle is sealed, the CO2 has nowhere to go, so it goes into dissolution in the beer, giving you that fizz.  Most bottled homebrew will be like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a beer that is both flat and was bottle-conditioned (and therefore still has some yeast in it), you might be able to bottle-ferment it again:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add a very small amount of sugar to the bottle.  Table sugar works, although corn sugar (which you can find from a brew store) is ideal.

According to it, the suggested pairing for an IPA is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Strong, spicy food (classic with curry!); bold, sweet desserts like carrot cake&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and for a Double/Imperial IPA is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Smoked beef brisket, grilled lamb; Southern chicken-fried steak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found a great little &lt;a href=&quot;http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/03/what-to-eat-with-ipa-india-pale-ale-food-pairings.html&quot;&gt;summary by Michael Agnew (2012)&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of the rationale behind these pairings (emphasis mine hereon):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When pairing IPA with food you have three basic flavor hooks at your disposal; bitterness, hop flavor (spicy, grassy, herbal, earthy, and citrus), and caramel. Hop flavors have a great affinity for spices and light fruits. Bitterness has a cooling affect. Paired with &lt;strong&gt;spicy dishes&lt;/strong&gt;, IPA will fan the flames at first, but douse them in the end. Bitterness also amplifies &lt;strong&gt;salty and umami flavors&lt;/strong&gt;. The caramel flavors in the beer will latch onto the sweeter side of a dish, tying into things like &lt;strong&gt;caramelized onion&lt;/strong&gt; or the crispy skins of roast poultry. And the hop acids and carbonation make IPAs &lt;strong&gt;great palate cleansers&lt;/strong&gt; to take on even the fattiest deep-fried delights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samuel Adams has a &quot;Pair with Sam&quot; tool, and looking at its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samueladams.com/food-and-craft-beer/pair-with-sam?beer-name=whitewater-ipa&amp;amp;beerid=7abae512-5798-4f59-bd3e-98698adcd1bf&quot;&gt;suggested pairings for their Whitewater IPA&lt;/a&gt; (hoppier than their Latitude 48 IPA), &lt;strong&gt;pork appears to be the meat of choice: pulled pork, barbeque ribs, chorizo, roasted pork tenderloin, and sweet sausage&lt;/strong&gt;; and the rest of its suggestions align with the salty-and-spicy pattern we've  seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We seem to have found strong consensus already, but just one more to make sure.

In the 18th century, most beers were dark due to being produced with barley malt that was kilned or roasted over wood fires.

In the turn of the 19th century and beyond, the style spread from England to the rest of Europe—&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When a new brewery was built in Pilsen in Bohemia in 1842, a coke-fired kiln was imported from England.

The latter is most affected by the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; of increase in blood-alcohol concentration: the greater this rate of increase, the greater the disturbance of function at any absolute concentration. The diuretic response, on the other hand, is dependent mainly on the &lt;em&gt;duration&lt;/em&gt; of increasing blood-alcohol concentration and not on the rate of increase (Tables 6, 7). The naturally slow absorber, therefore, tends to give a larger diuretic response than the rapid absorber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The slower you get drunk, the more dehydrated you'll be!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="73" LastActivityDate="2014-02-01T10:19:08.893" CommentCount="0" />

It’s a sentiment backed by Patrick Langlois at&#xA;  Great Divide in Denver, brewers of notable hoppy beers including their&#xA;  Fresh Hop Pale Ale, Titan IPA, and Hercules Double IPA. “Hops tend to&#xA;  dissipate in three to four months, which is why that is the&#xA;  recommended shelf life for most of our beers. &#xA;  (&lt;a href=&quot;http://beeradvocate.com/community/threads/how-much-does-keeping-a-beer-cold-really-help-retain-hop-aroma.6336/&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Barley Wines - Oxidation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barley wines are not hop flavor or aroma focused beers - the major hop component is bittering acids, so they don't suffer the same problem with aroma losses as IPAs. However, some of the bittering compounds also have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;amp;pid=S0100-40422000000100019&quot;&gt;half-life of 1 year&lt;/a&gt;, so clear changes are happening in that timeframe to the bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the major change for a barleywine is oxidation. There is always oxygen in the beer - either small amounts introduced during packaging, or from oxidization during the mash, which is then later released into the beer. When alcohol in the beer oxidizes, it becomes ethanal (acetaldehyde) which is a main component in sherry, and gives apple or sherry-like tones, which in a big barleywine are considered positive effects of aging, if kept in check. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Stouts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting with both IPAs and barleywines, Stouts that are meant for aging are neither hop focused nor benefit much from oxidation.

Fortunately, the highly kilned malts act as an anti-oxidant to help prevent the beer from oxidizing. What little odization does occur tends to produce port-like flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The roasty character in stout comes from large Maillard compounds. These are still poorly understood, I can't find research to back it up, but I would guess the roasty character mellows due to the large compounds breaking down into shorter ones.

We hear stories about wood alcohol making people go blind, but the real problems were either accidental heavy metal poisoning or deliberate adulteration with relatively nasty chemicals.  In practice methyl alcohol was not a major problem, particularly accidental inclusion of it, as in most concentrations primarily makes the hangover significantly worse (btw, red wine is known for harsh hangovers as are some fruit brandies because of methyl alcohol content).  The adulterants have included (and do include in some parts of the world) things like battery acid, caustic soda, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second problem of course is safety.  In the distilling process, you are dealing the combination, usually, of heating elements or open flames and a liquid that is roughly as flammable as gasolene.  While it is quite possible to distil safely, there are generally acknowledged gains health and safety-wise to pushing for a formal economy here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine Tastings vs Beer Tastings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here laws vary considerably between states.  For example, the one part of the liquor code that is explicitly applied to home brewers is an exemption for home brewing competitions.  So you can take your beer to a competition without losing the home brewing exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wine tastings have almost always had some acceptance on the theory that making fine wine has a level of cultural refinement and aesthetic nuance that beer does not (we may find this false but it an attitude --- if you don't believe me, compare reading a wine review with a beer review).  The wine culture is different from the beer culture and so they make a different case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again laws here vary state by state.  However, the argument, I think, is that wine tasting is essential to the sales process, while beer drinkers are less picky on average.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In essence these laws have a practical component particularly where hard liquor is concerned, and a cultural component.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="117" LastActivityDate="2014-02-03T08:57:40.450" CommentCount="0" />

Typically, gravity is expressed as thousandths over 1.0, where 1.0 is water.  However, Gnarly Oak says that their Winter Bock has an OG of 15, which is likely in degrees Plato.

Since its is mostly water, you can compare beer’s density to water to find out how much other stuff is in it.  Water has a gravity of 1.000, and beers will often have an original gravity of 1.200 to 1.020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Original Gravity” is the density of beer before it’s fermented (when it’s called ‘wort’), and “Final Gravity” is the density after it’s fermented.  You can determine the alcohol content of a beer by comparing the two gravities and inferring how much fermentable “stuff” disappeared during fermentation (i.e., was converted to alcohol and CO2).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In commercial beer, you can use OG as a shorthand for how “Big” the beer is because it indicates how much malt and other fermentable stuff was in it.  So a lighter-flavored beer like a blonde or a pilnser will often have a low original gravity (1.020 to 1.050, for example), whereas a big stout or barelywine might have a higher original gravity (1.080 up to as much as 1.200).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OG is in important measurement for home brewers, so another use of it on a commercial beer is to help people produce clones of said beer at home by reproducing the OG (among other factors).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Definition&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get a little more technical, Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one liquid to another.  In brewing, we always use water.  So, the density of water divided by the density of water is 1.000.  The density of beer divided by the density of water is what we refer to as ‘gravity’ when discussing beer.  And since it’s a ratio of two identical measures, there are no units.

The units here are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Strength&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;degrees Plato&lt;/a&gt; (&amp;deg;P), which describe the amount of dissolved sugars.

This means the beer (or more correctly, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wort&lt;/a&gt;) contained 15% sugar before fermentation started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RDF - The real degree of fermentation. This is in contrast to the Apparent Degree of Fermentation, which is (OG-FG)/OG. When the final gravity is measured using hydrometer, the alcohol in the beer, being less dense than water (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SG. 0.789&lt;/a&gt;) causes the gravity to appear lower, so it looks as though the yeast has fermented more sugar than it actually has. The Real degree of Fermentation takes the alcohol into account and computes the actual amount of sugars fermented.

This shows that knowing the residual sugars doesn't tell you the sweetness, simply because there are different kinds of residual sugar.

The reason has nothing to do with alcohol content or getting drunk (some beers like Belgian tripels, imperial stouts, or barley wines can easily clock in at a higher ABV than wines). It's got more to do with the human tongue itself and how taste buds are organized on the tongue. Essentially, beer is a much more complex drink; beer tasters use all of their taste buds while wine drinkers may only use a select few. So when you drink beer, you're not going to be overwhelming any set of taste buds unevenly while you run that risk when drinking wine.  Generally when drinking wine, you're only using your sweet and sour sets of taste buds. For instance, I don't know about you, but I've never really had a bitter wine. I've had sweet or sour wines, but never bitter or salty wines. On the other hand, I've had all of that with beer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the diagram of the tongue below, you'll notice that the bitter taste bud receptors are on the back of the tongue.

Almost all imported retail beer is pasteurized. The reason for pasteurizing the beer is from a business standpoint. It basically allows the beer to last longer and be shipped at room temperature (this applies to kegs, cans, and bottles). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to the pasteurization process is bottle conditioning. Most domestic beers follow this path. Essentially this process involves beers being sterile filtered and chilled to the point that any surviving bacteria, which could ferment the beer, become dormant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/pasteurized-and-non-pasteurized-keg-beer-aid-45.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So basically the probability that the beer begins to ferment is higher over time. A canned beer and a keg beer can taste the same if they both left the brewery at the same time, and both experienced the same conditions during the time it took them to reach you. It is just that kegs have a better chance of taking less time and of being better preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint though, bottles can cause broken glass, kegs weigh close to 50 lbs. full, and cans allow for shotgunning.

Beer is technically not distilled. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the definition you cited says, beer is the product of fermenting sugar derived from cereal grain which is dissolved in water. So water + grain + yeast = beer. The grain has to undergo a saccharification process where the carbohydrate chains (starches) in the grain are transformed into sugar (glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose...) which is then converted into alcohol by yeast. Fermentable sugar is extracted from barley through &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;malting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mash_%28beer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mashing&lt;/a&gt;. The yeast is generally added to the &lt;em&gt;wort&lt;/em&gt; (unfermented sugary water) manually by the brewer or wild yeast can fall into the beer from the air. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other processes may be involved with fermenting other grains. For example, in sake brewing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/05/making-koji-for-sake.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;koji&lt;/a&gt; (a type of mold) is grown on rice (and soybeans) before fermentation in order to convert starches into fermentable sugars, as rice does not contain the enzymes needed to convert its starches into sugars (note: sake is generally not consider beer, but there are beers made with significant quantities of rice, up to 100% rice beer is possible).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hops is not a necessary ingredient in beer, and beer was made for thousands of years before people started adding hops to it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These strong beers like Snake Venom are generally brewed to this high ABV level through freeze &quot;distillation.&quot; This isn't really distillation, because no heat is involved, so people still call them beers. But this is a concentration process similar to distillation. Alcohol has a lower freezing point than water, so when you freeze beer, you can remove the ice and you're left with a more concentrated beer. This is the process used in the German eisbock style. The brewers also start with a high ABV beer, using special ingredients (sugar sources other than malt, like table sugar) along with strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol and still continue to live and ferment. This process can be somewhat difficult and expensive, so it gets attention. In my opinion it's a novelty, but I guess people like it, because they sell a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="94" LastEditorUserId="94" LastEditDate="2014-03-30T18:49:31.573" LastActivityDate="2014-03-30T18:49:31.573" CommentCount="3" />

A low yet distinctive spicy, floral, sometimes perfumy hop&#xA;  character is usually found. Alcohols are soft, spicy and low in&#xA;  intensity. No hot alcohol or solventy aromas. The malt character is&#xA;  light. No diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Appearance: Deep yellow to deep gold in color. Good clarity.&#xA;  Effervescent. Long-lasting, creamy, rocky, white head resulting in&#xA;  characteristic “Belgian lace” on the glass as it fades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Flavor: Marriage of spicy, fruity and alcohol flavors supported by a&#xA;  soft malt character. Low to moderate phenols are peppery in character.&#xA;  Esters are reminiscent of citrus fruit such as orange or sometimes&#xA;  lemon. A low to moderate spicy hop character is usually found.&#xA;  Alcohols are soft, spicy, often a bit sweet and low in intensity.&#xA;  Bitterness is typically medium to high from a combination of hop&#xA;  bitterness and yeast-produced phenolics. Substantial carbonation and&#xA;  bitterness lends a dry finish with a moderately bitter aftertaste. No&#xA;  diacetyl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, although lighter than the&#xA;  substantial gravity would suggest (thanks to sugar and high&#xA;  carbonation). High alcohol content adds a pleasant creaminess but&#xA;  little to no obvious warming sensation. No hot alcohol or solventy&#xA;  character. Always effervescent. Never astringent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Overall Impression: Strongly resembles a Strong Golden Ale but&#xA;  slightly darker and somewhat fuller-bodied. Usually has a more rounded&#xA;  malt flavor but should not be sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Comments: High in alcohol but does not taste strongly of alcohol. The&#xA;  best examples are sneaky, not obvious. High carbonation and&#xA;  attenuation helps to bring out the many flavors and to increase the&#xA;  perception of a dry finish. Most Trappist versions have at least 30&#xA;  IBUs and are very dry. Traditionally bottle-conditioned (“refermented&#xA;  in the bottle”).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;History: Originally popularized by the Trappist monastery at&#xA;  Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Ingredients: The light color and relatively light body for a beer of&#xA;  this strength are the result of using Pilsner malt and up to 20% white&#xA;  sugar. Noble hops or Styrian Goldings are commonly used. Belgian yeast&#xA;  strains are used – those that produce fruity esters, spicy phenolics&#xA;  and higher alcohols – often aided by slightly warmer fermentation&#xA;  temperatures. Spice additions are generally not traditional, and if&#xA;  used, should not be recognizable as such.

Some beers, such as real ale (or cask ale) are served at cellar temperature, which while certainly above the temperature of a beer fresh out a refrigerator, at 12-14 degrees celsius (53-57F) is still much colder than room temperature.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To answer your question:&lt;/strong&gt;  Mulled beer &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; heated beer.  As with wine, mulled beer is usually warmed over a low stove or in a crockpot with spices, often including cinnamon, nutmeg, citrus zest, and a sweetener like brown sugar, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to include any additional ingredients, particularly if it already has strong spice or fruit characteristics.  So, any beer style that you heat is, in fact, mulled beer.     &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to styles of beer that would be suitable for mulling, Belgian Strong Dark ales would be good candidates, as would nice fruity lambics.   Barleywine ales, milk stouts, chocolate stouts, and oatmeal stouts I would imagine might also be nice.  The characteristics I'd look for would be a heavy body, more malty than hoppy, a bit of sweetness, and if present, dark fruit (plumbs, figs, raisins) or berries.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2014-02-13T14:54:30.793" CommentCount="1" />

The name was used to indicate the strength of the Westmalle beers. Originally there was the Enkel, Dubbel and Tripel. It is said that they represent the holy trinity. Later quadruppels were added. Both Dubbel and Tripel as name were first used by the Trappist brewery of Westmalle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Westmalle produced the first dark beer in 1856 named &quot;Dubbel&quot; (the recipe was changed in 1926). Dubbels are dark in color, and tend to have malt flavors dominating over hops. Whereas the Quadrupels have more of a fruit presence, the Dubbels tend to be a bit spicier with strong caramel flavors.

Before the discovery/invention of force carbonation methods, all beer was carbonated naturally via bottle or cask conditioning. But people were brewing alcoholic beverages commonly referred to as beer in antiquity, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Edward_McGovern#Investigations_of_ancient_dyes.2C_foods.2C_beverages.2C_and_other_organics&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; from these cultures (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiahu&quot;&gt;ancient China&lt;/a&gt;, Neolithic culture, etc) suggests that they were doing this in big stone and earthenware pots and jugs, which may have had no lids or loose lids. Their vessels probably could not have withstood the pressure of carbonation even if they were using wax or cork to seal the vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you were to brew a historical style and you wanted to be truly accurate, then you would not carbonate it.

A keg being dispensed using CO2 is a different story: that will last as long as bottled beer and can be warmed and rechilled without ill effects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In all of this, I am referring to room temperature.

They're not as popular amongst American brewers as triples though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as flavor profile, it's a malty but dry beer.  The Belgian abbey yeast strains will ferment the beer fairly dry but will create a whole host of fruity esters and spicy phenols that will add to the mid range caramel malts.

Triples do NOT use 3x's the malt as a Single.  No brewer will tell you that, nor is it true historically.  Malt extraction is linear, meaning 3x's the malt will be 3x's the alcohol.  The closest you get to that is historically when the single was the 3rd running (like a small beer). With this method, the 1st run had triple the fermentables extracted than the 3rd run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And while I may only be a blogger, with 13 years of industry experience, I spoke with highly trained brewmasters and read references written by authoritative experts.

As such, the distinguishing factor is bitterness.  :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since hops are the primary contributor to bitterness in beer, high IBU beers also tend to be hoppy (although that's not always the case, since hops added at certain points in the brewing process contribute mostly to bitterness, while hops added at other points contribute mostly to hop aroma and flavor).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an aside, heavier beers (specifically, those with lots of malt) will taste less bitter than a lighter beer with the same IBU.  To elaborate:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;there is still the complication that IBUs do not really correlate with perceived bitterness because other aspects of beer affect the perception of bitterness. For example, two beers containing 25 IBUs will be perceived very different with respect to bitterness if one beer had an O.G. of 10 °Plato and finished at 1.5 °Plato and the other beer had an O.G. of 12.5 °Plato and finished at 2.5 °Plato.

With that said, I could probably shoot an email to the professor who I took the class with if you want more info, but I think my answer will suffice (but please let me know, he is a pretty cool guy).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I would presume it has something to do with Russian culture and the importance of honey in that part of the world. I remember when I was a kid (like 2nd  grade I think), we read a collection of short, non-fiction stories of a Russian girl and her grandfather, who was a beekeeper. I cannot remember what the name of the book was nor the author nor whether or not the stories took before or during the Soviet era; but I do remember that honey played a really important role in most of the stories.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course there is other more concrete evidence other than my childhood reading material. For instance, just take a look at Russian cuisine. They have a mead-like beverage called &lt;a href=&quot;http://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/medovukha/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Medovukha&lt;/a&gt;, which is made with honey and yeast. It's apparently a traditional drink at weddings over there. Also, you've got Russian honey cakes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://russian.lingualift.com/blog/honey-tradition-russia/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;other food based items&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, honey is also a good preservative as it's antibacterial, so it was often mixed in with jams back in the day to preserve them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I'd be surprised if many of the ex-soviet brewers didn't use honey as an additive to their beer. Especially if the beers you have in mind are bottle conditioned, they would need to add a sweetener of sorts for proper carbonation. I've used honey in two of my home brews and I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some substantiating points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Baltika Medovoe Light seems to be a popular &quot;first Russian beer&quot; to try. It's a pale lager with natural honey added.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed honey does seem to have played a central role in Russian culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Like the Assumption, the three &quot;Saviors&quot; (&lt;em&gt;Spas&lt;/em&gt;), August 1, 6, and 16, were associated with the fruits of the earth. The first was called the &quot;Honey&quot; (&lt;em&gt;medovyi&lt;/em&gt;) or &quot;Wet Savior&quot; (&lt;em&gt;mokryi Spas&lt;/em&gt;), signifying either the gathering of honey or the religious procession and blessing of the waters traditional for this day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=-s36xYcqG1EC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ivanits, L. &quot;Russian Folk Belief.&quot; [http://books.google.com]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;According to Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevskii (1841–1911), we must learn about the Russian forest, river and steppe in order to understand the Russian people. [...] &quot;The forest provided the Russian with oak and pine to build his house, it warmed him with aspen and birch, it lit his hut with birchwood splinters, it shod him in birch bast sandals, it gave him plates and dishes, clothed him in hides and furs and fed him honey. The forest was the best shelter from his enemies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=EDvKpNzNBD0C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Riordan, J. &quot;Russian Fairy Tales and Their Collectors.&quot; [http://books.google.com]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's notable how closely intertwined honey and their ideals of paradise were, as found by a search for the term &quot;honey&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=C46rAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=honey#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=honey&amp;amp;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;The Paradise Myth in Eighteenth-century Russia: Utopian Patterns in Early Secular Russian Literature and Culture&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (Baehr, S.

I was lucky enough to visit Westvleteren a while ago and found out that in the nearby cafe you also could buy one crate per person, however there were only about 100 crates available that day and only one type was available. You can drink all types though by ordering it to drink in the café (3 types).&#xA;If you would ever want to taste Westvleteren but cannot find it, Sint-Bernardus Abt 12 is a very similar beer.

With many other competing beers, and demand checked by relatively higher prices, the abbey alone suffices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The volume produced, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketsmedia.com/chimay-turns-150-week-manchester-pub-nyc-celebrates/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this 2012 article&lt;/a&gt;, is 120,000 hectoliters of beer annually, or 16,000,000 bottles (750 mL) of beer.

I looked up Stella Artois' production figures (and not because it's Belgian—it was just the first popular, global beer to come to mind), and found that in 2012 they produced a little over 10,000,000 hectoliters that year. Divide that by Chimay's 120,000 hectoliters per annum. Can I believe that 83 units of Stella are being consumed for every 1 equivalent unit of Chimay?

Radler means cyclist in German.  The way I understand the story is that a small pub owner was besieged one day by a slew of thirsty cyclists and knew that his beer supply wouldn't hold out, so he cut it by mixing it with some sort of lemon drink he had on hand.  As far as I know this origin story isn't confirmed and Radler likely grew out of folk attempts to &quot;sessionize&quot; and extend the supply of leftover lager through the summer when lower alcohol and more refreshing drinks were wanted.  According to wikipedia the first printed mention of Radler as a drink was in 1912: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20&quot;&gt;http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/4594/20&lt;/a&gt;  I believe contemporary Radlers use a lemon-soda sort of drink that's more like a carbonated lemonade than what we'd think of as soda.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shandy itself is short for Shandygaff which is a British English term from the mid-1800s referring to beer cut with ginger beer or ginger ale. In fact, the OED still defines it as such while Mariam-Webster has loosened it up and allows for any non-alcoholic drink to be used in place of ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to their reputation, if you'll forgive me a little supposition, most commercial shandies are very pale duplications of mixing lemonade (or lemon soda) with a beer yourself.  The first commercial example I saw was Lienenkugel's and it was abusively sweet.  Sam Adams and The Traveler have fared a little better, but I think a major problem is that to commercially produce a shandy you need to heavily filter and pasteurize the beer and lemonade  to make sure the sugar doesn't ferment or use a non-fermentable sugar, which would change the taste from fresh beer and fresh lemonade.  At the scale a lot of breweries operate at, it possible some of them aren't even using real lemonade regardless of sugar type.  Also, while continuously popular in Europe, beer cocktails never caught on or were lost in America and we tend to think of them now as marketing gimmicks by macro-brewers (Bud Light Lime, Bud Chelada, Miller Chill), though as they become more visible, I think they'll become more accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, fresh shandy is incredible, I like using wheat beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2014-03-27T19:47:31.307" CommentCount="1" />

Snifters are widely used for beer and generally for two reasons, in my experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As you suspect, the bowl shaped glass helps to concentrate the aroma.  However, this isn't unique to the snifter as many types of beer glasses incorporate a narrowing throat to provide this effect. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quantity.  With a glass of beer that has a particularly high alcohol content, or particularly strong flavor, you'll often get much less than a standard 12-16 oz. pour.  The beer you refer to for instance, the Big Bad Baptist, has an alcohol content of 11.8% ABV, which closer to wine than beer, (and wine has a standard 5oz serving size per glass, or thereabouts) so it calls for a smaller serving size.  However, a 5oz or 6oz serving would look rather silly in a pint glass, so a snifter is more appropriate in proportion. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2014-04-03T22:09:07.270" CommentCount="2" />

It turns out that you have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can call and make an appointment and IF you get an&#xA;appointment then you must drive there at the appointed time to pick&#xA;up your crate of bier. If you can't make it at the appointed time&#xA;then you lose out, and you must start the process all over again. I&#xA;forget how much bier this is for, but I think it is 24-48 bottles. Indeed when you make the appointment then you must supply your license place number which they use to keep track of you. They will not allow you to make 2 appointments with the same license plate number in a 60 day period. Additionally, the phone number you must call to get an appointment is always busy, I have heard of people using automatic redial for hours before they finally get through. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are in the area (again you will need a car, because there is no public transport, and biking there is unreasonable from most places.) You can pop in and there is a small shop next to the monastery where you can buy a 6 pack per person without appointment, and also with out a huge price markup. Of course while you are there you can also eat some good food, and buy other items that the monks make and sell. This is much less hassle, but you cannot get much bier, so it may not be worth trekking all the way out there specifically for this.  However if you are in the area already and you have the time to take a small detour then you should certainly pop in for lunch or dinner and get some tasty brew.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally if you are in the Benelux region you can sometimes find Westvleteren in local shops or cafes, however the prices range from 10-16 euros per bottle (in Amsterdam) which is a lot more than you will pay at the monastery.

If you don't pasteurize the juice (for long term stability), it turns alcoholic after a couple of days, and after the apple harvest everyone gets large cannisters of freshly pressed juice from the cooperative presses, bakes onion tarts (&quot;Dinnele&quot;), and eats and drinks this seasonal speciality, with more or less alcohol, depending on taste.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Most&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Must&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;must&lt;/a&gt;) or &quot;Süßmost&quot; (sweet must) is freshly pressed juice; once it has turned alcoholic (and sour) it has different names in different areas, such as &quot;Sauermost&quot; (sour must) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Apfelwein&lt;/a&gt; (apple wine).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within southern Germany and Austria, Frankfurt is not specifically famous for apple wine, the drink, because it is drunk elsewhere, too. What the region around Frankfurt is somewhat well-known for are the festivities surrounding the end of the apple harvest and the pressing of apple juice, which have been the background theme for a musical tv show, &lt;a href=&quot;http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zum_Blauen_Bock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zum Blauen Bock&lt;/a&gt; (The Blue Goat Buck), that ran from 1957 to 1987.

You said it's a home built system, yes?  So is this a mini-fridge conversion, chest freezer/keezer conversion, or some other kit?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what length are the beer lines?  Generally you need to balance CO2 pressure against beer lines to avoid consistently foamy pours.  If your system isn't properly balanced the beer will always be foamy, on every pour.  I have 5-6 foot lines in my kegerator and it works pretty well for me, when I was having foamy pour problems everyone suggested replacing them with 10 foot lines just to make damn sure the pour wasn't too violent.  Also making sure the lines are clean.  Any beer stone or other sediment in the lines is going to cause foam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Serving warmer with lower CO2 would also be a better step.  One frustrating thing about these sorts of adjustments is that it takes time for equilibrium to be hit.  So if you lower the CO2 pressure, the headspace is still pressurize.  You'll need to vent the keg via the pressure release valve.  Same deal with raising the temperature.  Once the beer actually comes up to the new temp, there will have been CO2 driven out of solution that you need to vent from the headspace via the pressure release valve.  It's a pain.  Regulators will also often have their own pressure valve, which you should poke and vent slightly when setting the pressure...especially when coming down since excess pressure in the system is going to mess with the reading.  So vent, watch it rise to the actual pressure, then adjust, vent again, and watch.  It takes some time but generally once you set it there's very little change required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell without seeing the speed of your pour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definitely check the keg temperature itself.  As a homebrewer I reuse kegs, so I have stickers on all my kegs that have a little temperature line.  These liquid crystal thermometers, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00026Z4PS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; title=&quot;this one&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, are pretty cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also check the ambient temperature using a regular thermometer and a small glass of water.  You should check temperature at multiple spots inside the kegerator, so you could fill some tumblers or shot glasses with water and place them at the bottom of the kegerator, then maybe on top of the keg, and then maybe a back shelf if you have anything like that.  This lets you know if you have any hot spots which you can reduce by reorganizing tubes or tossing a small computer case fan in there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you haven't disabled the dome light in the fridge, do so or find some way to make sure the switch stays down beyond a doubt.  When I first built my kegerator I was getting incredibly foamy pours and a huge contributor wound up being the dome light kept coming on and heating up the tops of the kegs and the beer in my lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another final check is the temperature inside of the tower.  If you have no way for the cold air to get from the body of the fridge into the tower the lines in the tower will get warm and cause foamy beer, though if the CO2 pressure is set correctly, this would likely only result in the first 1-2 pours being foamy, then it calms down until the lines warm back up.  A lot of people will put fans or run copper tubes up the towers.  I filled mine with insulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T12:40:35.717" CommentCount="0" />

Ignoring the taste of hoppiness, which is different from bitterness (dear Bob that myth needs to die), there's a limit to how much bitterness we humans can actually perceive.  Past about 100 IBUs the tongue straight up can't tell that there are any more.  Now we perceive the quality of bitterness differently.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So bitterness in beer is provided primarily by adding hops and boiling them for a long time.  The length of time and pH of the wort affects a chemical reaction called &quot;Isomerization&quot;, which is the process by which Alpha Acids in hop oils become Iso-Alpha Acids which stay stably in solution and make beer taste bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are also Beta Acids.  Generally these are in 1:1 ratio with the Alpha acids but sometimes there are more or less depending on the hop types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beta Acids are chemically Lupulones and Alpha Acids are Humulones.  We've identified 3 types of each as well: No prefix, Co-, and Ad-.  Most homebrewing hop packets list total alpha acid %, then % of those acids that are Cohumulone.  But straight IBUs don't take which acids were used to get to that number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humulone is thought to give the best, smoothest, most pleasing bitterness.  Cohumulone can be pretty abrasive, and the bitterness may seem rougher or more astringent...or just more bitter, even at the same IBUs.  Beta acids are also thought of as a &quot;rough&quot; bitterness, but they primarily produce bitterness via oxidation and can help long term shelf-stability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what all this really helps to answer, but I guess the main points are that you can't taste past 100 IBUs, but there are qualities to bitterness that can make some beers more abusive than others.  Also my final point is that hop flavor and aroma don't make a beer bitter.  If the hops have been boiled enough to actually make a beer that bitter...you do not taste those hops.  You can have hoppy beers that are smooth and not bitter at all by hop selection, yeast selection, dry hopping, and not boiling them hops very much.  You can also make beer more bitter by yeast selection and certain grains.  You can also make Ruination or Palate Wrecker, but the point is that hoppiness and bitterness are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastEditorUserId="268" LastEditDate="2014-05-01T13:42:42.137" LastActivityDate="2014-05-01T13:42:42.137" CommentCount="0" />

Beer is made from malted grain, which must first be mashed to convert starch into fermentable sugars. Beer must contain 4 essential ingredients: Malt extract (from the grain), hops, water and yeast. It may contain others as well, but if any of these four are missing it is not beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that your premise of &quot;that alcoholic drinks are essentially either Beers Wines or Spirits.&quot; is wrong because it oversimplifies and excludes some beverages. Besides mead and cider, there are also malt-based alcho-pop beverages (Mike's Hard Lemon, Twisted Tea, etc.) that I would not call beer either - they contain 3 of the four ingredients, but lack hops. There are other local indigenous alcoholic beverages around the world that don't fit any of these categories, like Japanese sake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many styles of beer -- so the word &quot;beer&quot; refers to all of them, and there is no style that is called just &quot;beer&quot;.

Brewers, like any other businesses, like for the general public to know that the anonymous tapped beer you're drinking is theirs.  That is why they provide branded glasses to bars, and request (or require) that their beer be served in their glasses.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a benefit to the mildly curved shape of this glass for this type of beer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my observations, yes, there is.  While the throat may not narrow as severely as a brandy snifter, the effect of concentrating the aroma is still achieved. Eyeballing it, I'd say that the curvature is somewhere in between that of my champagne flutes and my red wines glasses, which are presumed to have the same general effect.  More generally I'd say that a glass with a narrowing or restricted throat does concentrate the aroma, and the degree of restriction doesn't seem to matter significantly, to my nose.  (Assuming it isn't &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; great, that is.  Beer in a bottle or can, for instance, is definitely at a disadvantage.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to also look at a few of the reasons they state in their marketing material as well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The authentic shape of the body encourages the perfect balance of C02 and liquid, enhancing head retention and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have any evidence to back this up, but I suspect that this is probably the most legitimate of the claims.  This would have a significant effect on the experience of drinking the beer, it is going to be specific to their recipe, and it's a reason that's often given for custom beer glassware.  (Boston Beer Company laser etches the bottom of their Sam Adams Boston Lager glass to enhance cavitation, for instance.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The angles at the bottom cause a wave that works in harmony with the liquid alchemy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what this means.  Alchemy is the term for pre-chemistry, and primarily deals with trying to turn ordinary substances into gold.  I assume they're trying to insinuate that the glass magically turns Stella into better beer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The stem provides a means to hold the chalice so that the Stella Artois stays cold longer &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is plausible, and perhaps unfortunate.  This is why you are supposed to hold red wine glasses by the bowl (to warm the wine) and white wine glasses by the stem (to keep it cool.)   However, with wine, a serving is generally five ounces or so, compared to twelve or more of lager.   The effect certainly won't be the same given the significantly higher mass.   The unfortunate bit is that colder is not generally what you want when you're talking about good beer.  Colder is the realm of the cheap macro-brews like Coors Light.   Cold subdues flavor compounds, which is useful when the flavor of the beer is nasty, and not so useful when it's pleasant.  This certainly isn't a a requirement or general best practice for lagers as you won't find stemmed glassware used for Boston Beer's Samuel Adams Lager glass: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/DMcwF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Samuel Adams Boston Lager Glass&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or my classic Spiegelau Lager glass: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wn6wv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Speieglau lager glass&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or any of the glasses you'll see used for the many fine Lagers of Germany.  So, I have to suppose one of the following two reasons.  First, they may simply be pandering to the general belief that colder beer is better.  Second, it would be unfortunate if they were trying to hide a lack of quality by trying to ensure the beer was too cold to taste properly.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, and I've left this to last, because it's purely my opinion...I think they've chosen the chalice glass specifically because it's fancy, and that's the image they want to portray for their beer.  When people see the Stella glass, they don't want their beer to be lumped in with the pint-glass styles, they want it to stand out as sophisticated, and the chalice specifically gives it that cachet.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my top line and bottom line are down to marketing, with a bit of truth and a bit of fiction to all the bits in between. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2014-05-21T01:20:03.927" CommentCount="0" />

Batches of a beer that are brewed to be low alcohol will necessarily be different to those brewed at full strength which is why I would hope (pray?) that any brewer whose product is worth drinking would make a different beer, brewed at low strength for these markets. These beers can be as flavoursome and exciting as, if not more so than, higher strength beers.&#xA;The process to make the beer lower ABV is simply reducing the amount of sugar that can be converted into alcohol by using a lower sugar content mash either using specific lower sugar malts, using less malt, or using a yeast that will not support higher alcohol concentrations (alcohol kills yeast...!). Using less yeast won't work as the given yeast will continue to multiply to make up the shortfall. If you are not making real beer halting the fermentation early by killing the yeast with heat (or similar) will produce a lower alcohol beer but it will be sweeter as there is more unfermented sugar.

The actual beer you drank was likely brewed in St. Louis, however, as Beck's is wholly owned by AB InBev.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pale Lagers as a style are usually straw colored, up to a light gold with a white head.  The flavor is very light and dry with only slight malty sweetness.  A little crisp hop bitterness without too much hop aroma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most &quot;macrobrews&quot; will be somewhat similar, though the stock &quot;American&quot; variant of Pale Lager like Budweiser or Miller will have a corn sugar flavor to them and likely be a bit lighter in body.  Beck's claimed to adhere to the German Beer Purity Law which would prohibit the use of an adjunct like corn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;St. Pauli Girl is a very similar beer, and I think is even brewed in the same town as the original Beck's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to stick with imports just about any pale German lager is going to do it for you since it's a very traditional style.  Anything by Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, or Weihenstephan is solid and usually pretty easy to get ahold of.  Pilsner-Urquell is also a great beer, but it's in the Pilsner style so while it's still a pale lager Pilsners can have a sulfur-y or buttery tinge due to the green bottles and slight diacetyl.  Pilsners also have a strong hop character and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to try local or American brewed versions just about anyone's Session Lager (Full Sail comes to mind, as does Notch if you're near MA at all) should be similar.

You might also be interested in any brewery's Cream Ale, which is an Ale version of the Pale Lager style.  Kolsch style beers may also appeal to you since they share the same light body and slight maltiness.  Kolsch's are hybrid beers which are fermented warm like an Ale would be, but then cold conditioned like a Lager.  Officially Kolsch can only be brewed in Cologne, Germany, but many American breweries will make a Kolsch style since it drinks really well in the summer and provides more flavor variety than pale lager or Cream Ale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does that help?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastEditorUserId="1454" LastEditDate="2014-12-05T20:12:44.053" LastActivityDate="2014-12-05T20:12:44.053" CommentCount="8" />

It's worth mentioning up front that there are certain taste aversions that people have to different beers.  You mentioned getting her into a vanilla porter.  I have a favorite from Mill Street in Canada; they make a great vanilla porter.  The caveat though is that I like coffee a lot, and many people averse to beer tend to have trouble with the intense flavors of different varieties of beer, such as extreme hoppiness, heavily malted barley, or, darkly roasted barley that make up stouts and porters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You mentioned less fruity beers, but talked about &quot;Wild Blue&quot; when you mentioned that.  Wild Blue is a Blueberry flavored lager; it's basically a &quot;regular beer,&quot; but is infused with blueberry flavor to change it up.  I would look at other &quot;fruity&quot; styles that are still very authentic and internationally renowned, but pack less of a general beer flavor than a filtered rice/grain/barley beer would...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good starter would be a more heavily wheat based beer.  Styles like Belgian wheats or German hefeweizens have less of that pronounced &quot;regular beer&quot; flavor, but are still in their own right, very prolific styles.  I tend to find Belgian wheats/&quot;weisse/wittes(whites)&quot; to be a bit more &quot;chewy&quot; with more of a banana/coriander flavor than their full blown German counterparts.  Good wheats that I would recommend would be Franziskaner or Hoegaarden.  They're safe forays into that style of beer that I almost always tend to get for new drinkers.  The cool thing is that if she likes them, you can really experiment with other varieties in that field.  Belgian doubles and triples tend to generally fall into a similar category, and they're arguably some of the finest beers in the world...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1120" LastActivityDate="2014-08-06T16:57:38.080" CommentCount="4" />

So Andy got hold of a camera that takes 750 frames a second and recorded some rather gorgeous video clips of what was happening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A careful analysis of the video confirmed findings: Beer bubbles do sink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The answer turns out to be really very simple. It's based on the idea of what goes up has to come down. In this case, the bubbles go up more easily in the centre of the beer glass than on the sides because of drag from the walls. As they go up, they raise the beer, and the beer has to spill back, and it does. It runs down the sides of the glass carrying the bubbles -- particularly little bubbles -- with it, downward. After a while it stops, but it's really quite dramatic and it's easy to demonstrate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon also occurred in other beers, said Alexander&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;The bubbles are small enough to be pushed down by the liquid.

I am somewhat aware of the evolution of the UK brewing industry, but nowhere near as knowledgeable as I am about America's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, definitions.  Craft Beer commonly derives the Brewer's Association definition of a Craft Brewer.  Which is Small, Independent, Traditional.  Sparing the specifics it's a definition meant to exclude the world's largest brewing companies, and their &quot;crafty&quot; portfolios.  &quot;Crafty&quot; is a pejorative used to describe brands or brewers which may or may not produce good tasting beer, but are owned by the larger brands in attempts to diversify their portfolios.  While the BA is primarily focused on the American market, it seems most European writers defer to their terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Real Ale, is a distinctly British term.  Coined by CAMRA in the 70's it's more to do with the packaging and serving of the beer in the pub than the business scale of the brewer.  All Real Ale has to do is be cask conditioned and served via a gravity tap or hand-pulled with a beer engine.  This excludes a majority of what we in the US would consider craft beer, because it excludes anything kegged, filtered, force carbonated, or pushed with pressurized gas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leads to an interesting overlap where an unfiltered beer, carbonated by natural fermentation, could NOT be a real ale because it was kegged and served on gas.  Also, nothing prevents a large brand like Murphy's or Beamish (both owned by Heineken) from marketing a &quot;Real Ale&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These definitions aside: It sounds like you may just be an IPA fan.  Your craft beer list is entirely IPAs.  It's not really accurate to conflate Craft and IPAs because plenty of craft beers are stouts, rye beers, Scotch ales, English bitters, or totally non-traditional things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue you might have with &quot;Real Ale&quot; is a technical note.  Because it's exposed to oxygen as soon as the cask is tapped real ale tends to spoil if it's not drank quickly.  The characteristic tastes of oxidized beer are cardboard, and the characteristic tastes of beer left on dead yeast for way too long is soapy.  I can easily see that coming off as &quot;waxy&quot;, especially if it's warmer than you're used to drinking and you've just downed some IPAs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beer today is probably the best its ever tasted because of refinements in production techniques and farming.  Consumers are becoming interested in what their beer is made of so the quality of ingredients and care on a whole is improving.  But real ale is a niche,  there are going to be great traditional brewers making phenomenal beer, but it's prone to spoilage if not treated well.  There may also be those using it as a marketing gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally a last point about industrialization:  It has vastly improved the quality of ingredient and process that all brewers use.  The huge brands we now have, all started off as craft at one point.  But if they are no longer craft they either couldn't weather the market and faced the choice of no longer being a company or selling to a business and risk becoming more about business than beer.  In the US we have large breweries proving you can still be pretty big and make good beer.  Sam Adams, Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head, Yuengling, are HUGE by craft standards and haven't compromised the quality of their ingredients because brewers are still in charge.  Industrialization will never prevent a brewery lead by a passionate brewer from making interesting beer, but leaving brewing decisions up to a business man will always making boring beer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="268" LastActivityDate="2014-10-17T14:30:48.050" CommentCount="1" />

I also know that, in between those two extremes, the relationship is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; linear (&lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, 3.2% ABW is approximately 4.0% ABV). However, any web-site calculator that I see pretty much performs the calculation as linear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been fiddling with my TI-89 from high school, and I think that I have it figured out. Assuming ethyl alcohol has a density of .789 kg/l and water has a density of 1 kg/l and assuming that water and alcohol are the only substances in an alcoholic beverage (which I know isn't true), the formula is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ABV = ABW ÷ (.211 · ABW + .789)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I can't confirm my formula. I'm searching Google and can't find much on the topic. Well… I can find plenty of calculators, but they all seem to be using a linear formula.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So… is this formula correct?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: So, I've done a little more tweaking on this (after I already got the accepted answer). I already made the assumption that the density of water is 1 kg/l. The density that I used for ethyl alcohol was for 20°C. At that same temperature, water has a density of approximately .99823 kg/l and not 1 kg/l. Using this, I arrived at a different formula that's probably more accurate (at 20°C, that is):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ABV = (99823 · ABW) ÷ (20923 · ABW + 78945)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1445" LastEditorUserId="1445" LastEditDate="2014-11-29T04:24:15.507" LastActivityDate="2014-11-29T04:24:15.507" Title="by-volume/by-weight conversion formula" Tags="&lt;alcohol-level&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />

Men tolerate alcohol better than women and some guys are very quick metabolizers, so they get alcohol out of their blood very quickly. The same reasoning aplies to drugs that act on the central nervous system. They have a sedating effect similar to alcohol and one may not feel one hundred percent alert while others may feel extremely sedated and unable to perform tasks that require attention and precision. For all this, there is always a warning about mixing alcohol with those drugs. However, effects vary a lot and you may get away with drinking and taking an SSRI such as Fluoxetine, Paroxetine or Sertraline.

Lots of beers would also have been strained through spruce post-boil which would've given them some wood or pine quality.

A lot of early drinks were like that, involving some sort of concentrated or burnt sugar in addition to grains, which generally weren't barley at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in the most ideal case where you had access to the best beer you could find...it would be some form of brown ale or lighter porter.  Maybe an amber ale if you could find one that wasn't very hoppy.  The stable kilning process that enabled people to make pale malt wasn't really invented until the mid-1600's and wasn't very popular until the 1700s, so brewers in the 1600s would've used a sort of generic-y brown malt that might taste slightly burnt and premium beers may have been able to include some lighter malt that was much harder to make and find.

For the common man (not nobility), in particular, grain made up a substantial part of the diet, with meat being fairly rare.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Common beer was not aged for months or years like some beers today; rather, a batch might be produced in as little as half a week.  These are &quot;small beers&quot; (or &quot;small ales&quot;, for the unhopped variety), which are mildly alcoholic but drinkable in volume without unfortunate effects.  These small beers/ales were produced in the home/manor; it was just one more task for the cooks.  See, for example, Markham's &lt;em&gt;The English Housewife&lt;/em&gt;, 1615. (I don't know of an online copy, sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that this means that the pilgrims wouldn't have brought beer from Europe; it'd be consumed, or probably go bad, before they reached the new world. So they probably didn't have beer in their &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; year because they'd need to wait for a grain harvest.  After that, if they brought hops with them then they could have made small beers like from the old country; if they didn't bring hops, they probably made ales instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turkey would have been new to their palates (it's a new-world bird), but beer was commonly drunk with meals where they came from, and those meals sometimes included other fowl.  So, probably it pairs fine.

There's been big debates over to what degree they were aware that water caused diseases while beer did not, but a big factor was that beer was seen as nourishing (which it is) while water was not. In an age where getting enough to eat was a recurring challenge, this contributed to making people prefer beer/wine. In practice it seems people preferred alcoholic drinks for both reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, people would drink small beer as an everyday drink against thirst (and that's what children got, too), and beer proper for celebrations. That's actually a Finnish saying: &quot;small beer for work, beer for celebration&quot; (&quot;Kaljalla työt tehdään, oluella pidot pidetään&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Small beer was generally made together with beer. That is, they'd do a mash, and the first wort that's run off has the most sugar. As you keep pouring water through, obviously more and more sugar is washed out of the malts, and the wort keeps getting waterier. Eventually they'd stop, and make beer from the wort. Then they'd continue, and run off a much weaker wort from the remaining sugar in the malts. This was the small beer. Many places they would even do a third beer, which was so weak it would barely ferment. There were also other grain-based drinks, made from flour or bread, and typically sour and just barely alcoholic. Kvass is the best-known example, but there were many others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Weak beer as an every-day drink continued for much longer than you might think. It was the introduction of tea/coffee that first started displacing it. Then, later, higher availability of milk, then juices and soft drinks continued the process. On Gotland, off the coast of Sweden, children were drinking weak beer as late as the 1960s.

CO2 absorbs more in colder conditions, but if anything freezes, even partially, CO2 gets driven out of solution.  Normally when you refrigerate kegs indoors they're hooked up to gas, so as pressure in the headspace drops it's less likely the keg will unseal itself.  Also, if the keg did freeze a bit the CO2 being forced into the headspace could conceivably go over the pressure limits of the keg, depending on how carbonated it was to begin with among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of leaving a bottle or can in the freezer to chill it quickly then forgetting about it.

The yeast used for an amber ale is most likely not tolerant enough to go very far outside the recipe, and beer that is &lt;em&gt;too alcoholic&lt;/em&gt; for the recipe generally tastes pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3675" LastActivityDate="2015-01-11T19:58:15.630" CommentCount="0" />

The reason [major producers] don't sweat over the IBU inside that range is because the human palate can't detect the difference. Studies have shown that the detection threshold for bitterness is about 5 IBU. And that is for beers in the 10 to 15 IBU range.

An interest in the history and production of these beers is best served by Phil Markowski's &lt;em&gt;Farmhouse Ales&lt;/em&gt; and Stan Hieronymus' &lt;em&gt;Brew Like a Monk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To touch on a few of your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously alluded, beer served a utilitarian purpose as a dietary staple and nutritional supplement for an agrarian society. Beer was frequently brewed in large batches at regular intervals in support of farm life, and the result were table beers and saisons for work during the harvest and &lt;em&gt;bières de garde&lt;/em&gt; (loosely translated: &quot;beers for keeping&quot;) to survive the winters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbey ales are not as varied as they initially appear. Much of the variation in beers brewed in Trappist style come from fermenting different &quot;runnings&quot; of the same batches of wort (unfermented beer); to summarize &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; briefly, the strength is dependent upon the sugar content which is dependent on how many times the mashed malt has been &quot;rinsed&quot;.

The differences in style we perceive now (e.g. IPAs vs Flemish sours) evolved by regional taste preferences from common roots: malt-forward beers (which were originally quite sour) using the low alpha acid noble hops which thrived on the continent.

Mulled beer is just nice when you're cold, and when you've got the cold, the last thing you want to feel is cold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stews, casseroles, and chilis don't ward off the cold either. That doesn't stop people from eating ample amounts of them come autumn and winter. Neither do chicken soup nor porridge reduce the duration of a cold. That doesn't stop nearly every culture around the world from serving some variation thereof (or a mix of both, in the case of congee) to sick people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, why stop there? Beer is nice too. All those things also help keep you hydrated, which can never be a bad thing if you're sick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, if it makes you feel better, it may as well ward off disease. I mean, it's right there in the word. Dis - ease. A lack of ease. If it puts you at ease, it's a remedy in my book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3864" LastActivityDate="2015-03-06T05:52:23.243" CommentCount="0" />
